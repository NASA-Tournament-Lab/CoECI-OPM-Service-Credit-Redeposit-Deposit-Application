Supervisors may view and print the daily reports on-line. These are the reports made by the nightly
batch service but this method queries the database again to pick up any changes since last night.
To regenerate the latest reports, on the Admin Page, click on the tab "Regenerate Latest Reports".

You will get following view:

The page shows which report had output and how many individual statements were printed for
each. Click each button to generate the reports with last night's data. The reports will be displayed

in the "Reports Viewer". For example, if you click "Initial Bills Invoice" you will see the following
figure.
