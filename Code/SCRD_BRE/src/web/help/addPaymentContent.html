Click this button to add a payment manually. This was called an "R3" payment. Only a Financial
Technician can add an over-the-counter payment. Refunds Sections workers can add "Prior Payment
Recorded" records that are never treated as payments except for initial calculations. Receivables
Technicians can add adjustments. Over-the-counter payment and adjustments must be approved by
supervisors before taking effect. What the user sees on their screen and the choices for payment
type depends upon their role.

<h2>Financial Technician</h2>
Funds Control enters "over-the-counter" payments that may or may not hit the GL. If the "Block
Number" starts with "9" then the payment will not go into the GL.

Financial Technician cannot make a payment to an account that has a credit balance.

<h2>Receivables Technician</h2>
Receivables Technicians enter corrections that do not hit the GL for one of two reasons. The money
might be adjusted or "written-off" so that there is no cash. The money came from another system
that already posted the cash to the GL.
<p></p>
Receivables can refund a credit balance. This amount must match the balance at the time of the
nightly batch process or else it will be rejected.

Receivables Technicians can adjust an account's payment total. This is allowed regardless of the
balance (zero, positive, or negative). It is also allowed if the status is active or history. The date of
this adjustment determines how it will update the master record. When the nightly batch processes

this adjustment, it will first get the master record payment balance on the adjustment date from the
audit trail. Then it will add up all the payments from that date to the present. It will add the value of
this adjustment (subtract if negative) to the sum and apply it to the account. This allows the users to
adjust accounts that were recalculated after being paid off. The adjustment done during the
recalculation can be shown in the payment list and the sum of all payments will match the master
record.

Receivables Technicians can also "write-off" balances of $25 or less. It does not matter if the account
is active or history.

<h2>Refunds Specialists</h2>
Boyers can enter "payment" records that will never be processed as money. They are only for
entering payments prior to the new system and will only be used for initial billing calculations.
