This is a list of Report documents that you can open from this screen. Click on the template you want
and you will see a summary of the report in a table. Click on the "Print" button to open the report in
the "Reports Viewer". From there you can print it. Each of these documents performs a database
query every time you open it. Some of the more complex reports might take a half-minute to open
during periods of heavy system use.
