Payments can be reversed for many reasons and many weeks after being received. When you
reverse a payment, a window pops up to ask why.

Clicking the "Reverse" button will open a Microsoft Word document which is a letter to the claimant
explaining why his payment was reversed and to expect a new invoice with a higher balance.

<h2>Cancel</h2>
Adjustments can be canceled for many reasons and many weeks after being entered. When you
cancel a payment, a window pops up to ask why. Its drop-down box offers the same reasons as the
reversals.
