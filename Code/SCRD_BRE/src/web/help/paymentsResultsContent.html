The search criteria are listed in the top part of the page. Since you may open as many of these pages
as you want, this will help you remember your search criteria.

A line just below the search buttons shows the number of matching payments found.

The grid shows the payments. The IDNum is the database identifier that is discretely displayed in the
status bar of the Suspense and Payment History tabs. The last column is the Import Record from the
lockbox bank, if applicable. In the example below, the "Posted Complete" payment records have text
in the Import Record column because the payment came from the lockbox. However, the "Batch
Auto Refund" records are generated by the nightly batch so they have no Import Record entry.

You may see and print the audit trail for any payment record by clicking the "Show Audit Trail"
button. The audit trail opens in the Reports Viewer. The "Copy to Clipboard" button will copy the
cells to the Windows clipboard so you may paste this information into another program. Excel works
very well as this grid is similar to a spreadsheet.

You can view the account associated to a payment by clicking "View Account" button.
You can add a payment by first selecting a payment (this will set the account associated to that
payment). Then click the "Add Payment" button. You can see help section on "Add Payment" for more
information.
