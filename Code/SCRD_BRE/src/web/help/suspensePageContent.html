On the "Suspense" page a Receivables Technician can see at a glance the status of the latest bank
input. Payment transaction details are displayed in the bottom tier that apply to the highlighted
payment.

<h2>Data Grid</h2>
When you enter the Suspense Grid or click the "Refresh" button, the program loads the current data
from the database. This "snapshot" of data will be neither automatically updated to show changes
by other users nor will update the database unless you tell it to. You may not edit any cell in this grid
except the "Post" checkboxes in rows where the payment state is "Unresolved."
<p></p>
The following information is displayed in columns for every payment in the grid.

<table class="helpTbl stdTbl" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<h2>Sorting Rows</h2>
To sort the rows by any column, click the header for the column. The grid is now sorted in ascending
order by that column. To sort it in descending order, click the column header again. For example, to
sort the table by the CSD number, click the column header right on the word "CSD." An upwards
pointing triangle shows that the grid is now sorted in ascending order by CSD. Click it again to sort it
descending order and the triangle points down.

<h2>Payment Transaction Details</h2>
Click in the grid to select it and use the up and down arrow keys to move around. A right-pointing
triangle appears in the left grid border to show the current row. The boxes at the bottom of the
screen show information about the selected record. On the left are details about the payment while
information about the claimant appears on the right. Information highlighted in bold and yellow
quickly shows the problem with the record. For example all of the "Suspended" payments have the
"Payment CSD Number" and "Payment Date of Birth" highlighted because we cannot match them to

any claimant. A "Posted - Pending" payment will not have any fields highlighted. "Unresolved"
payments will show at a glance why they are unresolved. The birth dates might not match or
payment is for a history account. Highlighting makes the discrepancies easy to spot. In this example,
the payment is unresolved because the date of birth on the check is different from the account and
the account is paid off.

<h2>Resolving Suspense Payments</h2>
To resolve a payment, the payment must be corrected, the account must be corrected, or the
payment must be returned or transferred.


<h2>Post Checkbox</h2>
Only one column of the data grid can be modified by the user. Initially, the "Post" checkboxes are all
unchecked because this column is for the application user to select payments for processing. Users
may check the "Post" box for "Unresolved" payments if they want the program to correct the
payment's birth date and the account status. The account status will only change if the account
balance is greater than zero and is set to "History." Click the check boxes of all the "Unresolved"
payments that may be posted. When done, click the "Post Checked Payments" button. If you do not
click the "Post Checked Payments" button the checked records will not be updated. The application
processes these payments using this logic:
<ul>
 <li>If the payment's date of birth does not match the account's date, update the date of birth on
   the payment to match the account. Apply the payment.</li>
<li>If this account is in "History" status and also has a balance due, then set the account to
   "Active" status and apply the payment.</li>
<li>If these logical tests fail, then the payment reverts to the unresolved state.</li>

</ul>



<h2>Buttons</h2>
To work with the payments on the Suspense Page, select one in the grid by clicking anywhere in the
row and then click a button.

<h3>Refresh List</h3>
Select a payment and then click this button to throw away your recent changes or to update your
screen with changes that other users have made.
<h3> Reset Selected Payment</h3>
Selecting a payment and clicking this button will reset that payment to its earliest known state. This
is a way to undo all the work done by the analysts. The payment will be reset to its state as it came
from the lockbox bank.
<h3>Post Checked Payments</h3>
To avoid errors when resolving payments, the application requires a second step to apply the
changes. Clicking the "Post" checkboxes does not complete the task. Clicking buttons for "Refund
Payment," "Refer to Voluntary Contribution," or "Refer to Direct Pay Life Insurance" will not save
your changes. On your screen the payment status is "Ready for..." the new status.


<p></p>
The payments in the following states are NOT saved and can be lost. You must either click the "Post
Checked Payments" button or the "Refresh List" button.
<table class="helpTbl stdTbl" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

The payments in the following states have been saved and are ready to be approved by a supervisor.
If the supervisor approves them, they will change from the "Pending Approval" state to the
"Pending" state. If the supervisor disapproves them, they will revert to their original state from the
lockbox.

<table class="helpTbl stdTbl" border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">

<p></p>
The payments in the following states have been approved and will be processed overnight unless a
supervisor "resets" them to their original state.

Every few minutes or after you have completed a few payments, click on the "Post Checked
Payments" button to save your work. Alternatively, you can forego clicking this button to "undo"
your previous actions.
<h3> Print</h3>
This button will produce a printable list of the payments in the Reports Viewer.

<h3> Link Payment to Current Employee</h3>
This box is used to resolve suspense items. A suspense item has to match a data base account at a
minimum on the CSD and birth date fields. This box will facilitate the resolution of a suspense item.
The Receivables technician would perform the following:
<ul>
<li> Look up the suspense item and note the name or address.</li>
<li> Go to the employee tab.</li>
<li>Search on the name and address.</li>
<li> Find the claimant.</li>
<li>Click the Link Payment to Current Employee button so the suspense item's CSD number and
     birth date are corrected and the payment becomes "posted - pending".</li>
 </ul>
<h3> Make this Employee Current</h3>
This button is used to resolve an unresolved payment as follows:
<ul>
<li>Select an unresolved payment on the Suspense tab. Let's say the birth date is 1/2/1943.</li>
<li>Click the Make This Employee Current button.</li>
<li>Let's say that we view the Account Summary window and notice that the claimant's birth
       date is 1/1/1800 (obviously incorrect).</li>
<li>Go to the employee tab.</li>
<li>Correct the birth date.</li>
<li> Return to the Suspense tab.</li>
<li> Click the Post Checked Items button.</li>
 </ul>

The unresolved payment will be a match on both CSD number and birth date.
<h3>Transfer</h3>
Clicking on the "Transfer" button will pop up a window of transfer type choices. Select one and click
the "OK". See section 6.4 for more information.
<h3> Note</h3>
The "Note" button puts a payment note on the selected payment. It is a simple text annotation that
attaches to a single payment. It follows that payment even if it is linked to another claimant.
<h3> History</h3>
The "History" opens a printable audit trail of the selected payment in a Crystal Reports Viewer.
