<p>The new Service Credit Redeposit &amp; Deposit (SCRD) web application is developed to manage Service
Credit accounts, a process that was formerly handled by a Windows application. Accounts are
established for federal employees for periods of federal employment that are either not covered by
retirement deductions (deposits), or were covered and later refunded (re-deposits). There are two
primary groups that perform operations in the service credit system: "Refunds and Deposits" and
"Funds Management" Division.</p>

<h2>Web Application Sections</h2>
The users interact with the Service Credit System via the SCRD web site. This
web application updates the global database for the user.
The Batch Service is installed on one application server. It is the back end of the web application. The
administrators may monitor its progress via the front end using the notifications logs. This back end
reads in the Lockbox bank data and performs the nightly processing.


<h2>General Work Flow</h2>
When federal employees apply to make a deposit or redeposit, they submit Standard form 2803, or
Standard Form 3108 depending on whether they are currently enrolled in the Civil Service
Retirement System (CSRS) or Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS). In either case, the
employee completes part A of the application, then requests that the employing agency complete
part B of the application. The employing agency then sends the application to the Refunds Section in
Boyers. That office determines eligibility, calculates the amount due, and mails an initial bill (RI36-
23) to the claimant.
<p>
After receiving the bill, the claimant will send payments and changes of address through the Lockbox
bank. If the Lockbox data has no errors, the payment will be transmitted from the bank to OPM.
Every business day, OPM receives a file with Service Credit, Voluntary Contributions, and Direct Pay
Life Insurance. This file is split and distributed to these three systems. As soon as the Service Credit
file is available, the "batch" process will read it into the database. Users may notice this increase in
"Pending" payments in the late morning. There will be from 100 to 200 new payments per day.
Some of these will be "Suspense" so a user could be working on the last suspended payment, hit the
"Refresh" button and see twenty new suspense payments appear.</p>


The Batch Service processes payments immediately in order to post the good ones. The logic is
shown in the following diagram.

<h2>Nightly Payment Updates</h2>
Every night around 8:30 PM, the "Batch" process will process all the "Pending" payments. This
process will post all payments from the lockbox as well as post any payments corrected or redirected
to their proper account. After posting, new balances are calculated for the claimants and new bills
generated in Boyers.
This table shows the posting states from 'Pending' to 'Complete'. General Ledger (GL) entries are
only made after a payment is 'Complete'. This is different from the previous system that entered
the GLs as the payments came in. Suspense amounts went to GL 0504.

<h2>Bank Input</h2>
The bank input process that was established with the former mainframe-based service credit system
(SCRD) still remains in effect. On a daily basis the lockbox (US Bank in St. Louis) sends bank data via
host-to-host transmission to OPM's Data Center Group for three systems (Service Credit, Voluntary
Contributions, and Life Insurance). The reports that are generated in this process will continue to be
produced showing the bank input, as well as the totals and errors that occurred during host-to-host
and initial processing. Rather than send the service credit bank data to another mainframe
procedure as in the past, this file is converted to a text file format for processing in the new system.

<h2>Interfacing with Other Systems</h2>
Transferring money from the Service Credit System to Voluntary Contribution and Direct Pay Lift
Insurance is still done manually. The application will generate the proper paperwork but must be
signed and delivered to the correct office.
The GL File is made automatically by the batch service and loads data indirectly via a daily
ConnectDirect upload.
