The System Administrator can change user information, status and permissions with this option.
Supervisors can change user information and status but not permissions.
The "User Permissions" option is only enabled for supervisors. To access it, on the Admin Page click
"User Permissions" tab. You will then see a list of users.
<h2>User List</h2>
A list of users appear. The type of users depend upon the supervisor's role. Everybody appears if the
supervisor is a System Administrator. Otherwise the supervisor will see the following users:
<ul>
 <li>All new users</li>
 <li>Users directly supervised by you, regardless of their role</li>

<li>Users in a subordinate role supervised by somebody else (e.g., a Financial Supervisor will see
all Financial Technicians even if they are assigned to another supervisor.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
You can double-click on a user to view its information.
<h2>User Information</h2>
The following figure displays the information you can modify about a user.

<figure>
  <img src="i/help/editUserPermissions.png" alt="Edit User Permissions" width="700px">
  <figcaption>Edit User Permissions.</figcaption>
</figure>

The user status can be one of four types:
<ul>
 <li>Active User - Full access for their role
 <li>New User - No permissions
 <li>Separated User - No longer works with Service Credit
 <li>Suspended User - User access stopped
 	</ul>
 	<p></p>
The "Suspended User" and "Separated User" are functionally the same. Both are included for
annotation purposes.

<p></p>
For information about the permission roles, see the User Role Permissions report in the Reports tab.
Only the System Administrator can change this field.
All of the supervisors are in the Supervisor drop-down list. Pick the person that directly supervises
this user.
