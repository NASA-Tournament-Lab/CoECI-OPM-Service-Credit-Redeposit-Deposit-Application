<h2> Prerequisites </h2>
Before a new employee can use the Service Credit Application certain tasks must be performed.
<ul>
	<li>The supervisor must ask the Help Desk to add the user to the Service Credit Active Directory Global Group.</li>

	<li>The supervisor must ask the LANDesk to provide the new employee with a username and password.</li>


	<li>The supervisor must use the Service Credit program to enter the user's information and choose their "role" in the system.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Starting the web application</h2>
You can start the web application like any other website. Open you preferred navigator. For example
you can use Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, Opera. Enter the SCRD address in the
address bar. You will be asked to provide your username and password. Use the one given to you by
the Help Desk.
<p>
According to your role you might not see some features. If a feature of the Service Credit System is
not available (may be "grayed out"), and the user feels access is needed, refer to the group
supervisor who is able to grant access to certain functions based on a defined user role.</p>

<h2>Main Application Menus</h2>
Here is the main application windows.

You can see the main menu. It will be present at every page.
You can select the relevant checkbox on the previous figure to make any
page your home. The home page will be the first page you will see when you visit the web
application after log in. By default your "Account Details Page" will be the home page. If you think
you will be doing more approval jobs, you can set the approval page as your home
