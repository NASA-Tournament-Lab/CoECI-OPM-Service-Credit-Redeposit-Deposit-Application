Some features in the Service Credit system require membership in a role with enhanced
authorization - such as "Refunds Supervisor" or "Accounting Supervisor." These features are known
as "Administrative Functions." Some of these Administrative functions may be accessed from the
menu of the Service Credit application under the heading "Admin". Click on "Admin" to access the
Admin Page.

From there you will be able to "Regenerate Latest Reports" or configure "User Permissions".</p>
