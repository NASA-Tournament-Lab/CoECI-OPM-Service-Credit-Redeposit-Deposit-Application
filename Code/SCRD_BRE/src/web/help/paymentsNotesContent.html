A note may be attached to a payment and will always stay with that payment. In the rare case that a
payment is moved to another account, the note will remain with the payment always. Notes are
audited so that all values and changes are logged.

Clicking the "Show Note" button or clicking the first column of the payment and selecting the "Show
Note" option will pop up the window. If there is already a note, it will be shown. You may add or edit
the existing text. Clearing the text will delete the note. You must click the "Save" button or press the
enter key to save your work. Note the explanation in the status bar.

note has been saved into the database.
