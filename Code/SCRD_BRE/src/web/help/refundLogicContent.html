<h2>Suspended Payment</h2>
A Suspended Payment is one from somebody without a Service Credit account. Since Service Credit
received the funds in error, they must refund them. The Receivables Technician determines that the
payment should not have been cashed for Service Credit and changes its state from "Suspended" to
"Suspense Refund Pending Approval." <br>The supervisor approves this action and changes the payment
status from "Suspense Refund Pending Approval" to "Suspense Refund Pending." Now it's ready for
the Nightly Batch Process to finish the job. The Nightly Batch Process will mark the payment as
"Suspense Refund Complete" and make the offsetting "Batch Auto Refund." Now there is credit
entry as well as a debit entry on the ledger.

<h2>Unresolved Payment</h2>
An Unresolved Payment is one from somebody with a Service Credit account but there is something
wrong with either the payment or the account. Since Service Credit received the funds in error, they
must refund them. The Receivables Technician determines that the payment should not have been
cashed for Service Credit and changes its state from "Suspended" to "Suspense Refund Pending
Approval." The supervisor approves this action and changes the payment status from "Suspense
Refund Pending Approval" to "Suspense Refund Pending." Now it's ready for the Nightly Batch
Process to finish the job. The Nightly Batch Process will mark the payment as "Suspense Refund
Complete" and make the offsetting "Batch Auto Refund." Now there is credit entry as well as a debit
entry on the ledger.


<h2>Credit Balance</h2>
If a payment comes in for an account with a credit balance, the payment will be unresolved and the
Receivables Technician has the option to refund the account's credit balance at the same time when
they refund the overpayment. If the technician clicks "Yes" for the additional refund, the refund
amount on the Refund Memo will equal the sum of the account's credit balance and the refunded
payment. The supervisor will see this sum on the approval screen as well.<p></p>

The process is different from the Suspended Payment refund only in that there is the optional refund
of the pre-existing credit balance.
