To access the Batch Printout Archive, go to the "Tools" Page. Click on the "Batch Printout Archive"
tab.<br>
The nightly batch process saves all its printouts in a network folder. You can view these files on
screen. You can also print all or part of the document.<br>

The program looks up the print archive PDF files in the network share. Double-click the report of
interest to open it in Adobe Acrobat reader. Use that program to navigate and print.
