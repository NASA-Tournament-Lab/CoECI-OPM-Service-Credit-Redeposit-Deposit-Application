This tab shows all payments processed by the SCRD. These include checks &amp; ACH from the Lockbox
Bank, checks &amp; credit cards over-the-counter payments, and adjustments. The Refunds Section also
sees their "Prior Payment Recorded" records which represent payments prior to April 2006 or
agency credits.


<h2>Payment History Table</h2>

After an account has been retrieved (using the Account Search Function), the payments for the
account show on the Payment History tab. The grid displays the Batch, Block, &amp; Sequence Number
from the lock box bank. This allows the user to identify the payment vis-à-vis the bank's paperwork.
The Transaction Date is the date that the lock box bank accepted the ACH or check payment. All
payment types for the current claimant account are shown, even if they are unresolved (in
suspense). The "Applied To" order will show "Default User Order" unless the claimant requested
special processing for that particular payment. The User is set to "Automated Batch" if nobody
modified the payment. The last user to work with a payment is named in this column. The "GL"
column shows if this payment will hit the General Ledger or not.
<p></p>
Note that the count &amp; total of valid payments in the data grid match the count &amp; total in the
"Account Summary" section

<h2> Buttons </h2>
The enabled buttons depend upon the user's role and the payment's transaction status.

Most of these options duplicate button functions but two are different. The "Audit History" choice
will bring up a printable audit trail of the payment record. The "Delete Payment" option will delete a
manual entry if it has not yet been approved. Most record types cannot be deleted and must be
reversed or cancelled with supervisory approval. The Payment Receipt is reproduced in the Reports
Viewer.
<h2>Functions</h2>
The different functions offered on this tab are:

<ul>

<li>Reverse Payment<br>
To back out (reverse or cancel) a payment, click in a row and then click the Reverse Payment
or Cancel Voucher button. A pop-up window will prompt you to select a reason. Select from
the drop-down list and click the "Reverse" or "Cancel" button. Microsoft Word will open a
new Refund Memo with most of the fields filled in.</li>

Click this button to add a payment manually. This was called an "R3" payment. Only a
Financial Technician or Supervisor can add a payment.</li>

payment. This is not available for all types.</li>
