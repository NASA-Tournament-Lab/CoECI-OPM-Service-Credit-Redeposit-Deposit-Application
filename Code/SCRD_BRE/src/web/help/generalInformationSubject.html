The new Service Credit Redeposit &amp; Deposit (SCRD) web application is developed to manage Service
Credit accounts, a process that was formerly handled by a Windows application.
<p>Accounts are established for federal employees for periods of federal employment that are either not covered by
retirement deductions (deposits), or were covered and later refunded (re-deposits). There are two
primary groups that perform operations in the service credit system: "Refunds and Deposits" and "Funds Management" Division.</p>
