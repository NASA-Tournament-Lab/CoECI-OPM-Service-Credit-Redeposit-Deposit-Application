You can access the Service History tab in the Account Details page, when clicking on "Service
History".
This tab is used by Boyers but DC users have permissions to view it. Information about the claimant's
service is typed into the upper table. The lower part of the screen is filled after the calculation is
done.

<h2>Service History Versions</h2>
An account can have many calculation versions but only one may be the "official" billing. Users may
try different scenarios for a claimant. Each scenario is a Calculation Version. Choose one from the
drop-down list or click the "New Version" button. To copy the displayed information into a new
version, first check the "Copy Current" box.

<h2>Service History Data Grid</h2>
Each line of service is a date range and a description of the service performed during that time
period. Each of the "Type" fields is a drop-down box as shown to the right. Choose the correct value
for each field. You can also enter the amount for the period.

After the service history is entered, click on the "Validate Entries" button to check the dates. If there
is a Refund or Lump Sum, then a dialog box pops up to ask for the date of the actual payment.
This "Validate Entries" button will check the service periods and place a warning icon <img src="i/icon-error.png" alt="error" width="22" height="22" class="vMiddle" />
when there is an issue. Double-click the icon to get help solving the problem.

If this claimant has already sent payments to Service Credit, click the "Apply Real Payments" check
box. The payments from the Payment Tab will be applied to the bill. If this box is unchecked, then
only payments entered by the Boyers Refund Section will be applied to the bill. Refund Section
"payment" records are labeled as "Prior Payment Recorded" and do not appear to other groups.

When the service history is ready, enter the correct date in the "Calculate As Of" box and click on the
"Run Calculation" button. The program will calculate the amounts but not save them. It will also
insert account notes with a detailed explanation of the calculation. The "Show Calculation" button
will open a Microsoft Word file with this explanation.<p></p>
Nothing is saved until the "Save Calculation" button is clicked. Click on the "Save Calculation" button
to save the calculation results in the database so others can see them. The "Trigger Bill" button will
be enabled once the results are stored. Only a supervisor can trigger a new initial bill for an active
account.

overnight from the batch service.

The service histories are aggregated and the billable service periods shown in the results table. The
payments are applied by type and date. Clicking the "Show Sample Initial Bill" button will display an
initial bill for these results in the Reports Viewer.
