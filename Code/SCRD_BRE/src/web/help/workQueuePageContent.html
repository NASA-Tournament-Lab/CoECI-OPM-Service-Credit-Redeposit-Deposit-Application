The Refunds Sections use the tools on this tab to keep track of assigned and pending cases.

<h2>Show Assigned Cases</h2>
When this option is checked, the list shows all assigned cases assigned to you. If you are a
supervisor, it also shows the cases assigned to all the people you supervise. Supervisors can assign a
case to somebody else.

<h2>Show All Pending Cases</h2>
When this option is checked, the list shows all pending cases. You can assign a case to yourself. If
you are a supervisor, you can assign a case to your workers.
