You can access the billing summary tab by clicking on "Billing Summary" in the Account Details
page. This page will only displays if the associated account has billing information.
It will allow to view and edit the account billing summary information.

<p></p> You will be able to edit billing summary information such as:
<ul>
 <li>Dates (1st billing date, Last Payment date, Last Transaction date, etc)</li>
<li>Payment amounts for FERS, Post 9/82 Deposit and Redeposit, Pre 10/82 Deposit and
   Redeposit</li>
<li>Interest amounts for FERS, Post 9/82 Deposit and Redeposit, Pre 10/82 Deposit and
   Redeposit</li>
 <li>Total payments for FERS, Post 9/82 Deposit and Redeposit, Pre 10/82 Deposit and Redeposit
Payment order</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
Note that you can adjust the values of the total payments but the five numbers must still add up to the
same value. E.g., for an account with a total of $5000.00 in payments, you may add $1000.00 from
pre-10/82 deposit and add $1000.00 to post-9/30 deposit because the numbers would still add up
the same.
To adjust values, click on the "Edit Billing Info" button. Make the necessary changes. When done,
click the "Save" button to save the changes.

If you made changes to one of the Additional Interest or Total Payments cells, then the changes will
not take effect immediately. The values will revert back to the originals and a pop up window will tell
you that the request was submitted. The request is also logged in an account note.
