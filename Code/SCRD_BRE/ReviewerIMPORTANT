1- To avoid unexpected error make sure of the following
  a) Make sure your VM/laptop is connected to Internet
  b) Stop JBoss
  c) run ant db-test-data  (VM where you run this ant command should be connected to Internet)
  d) run ant deploy (VM where you run this ant command should be connected to Internet)
  e) Start JBoss



2- The jboss server will start with a maximum of 1300 Mb of RAM. Make sure your VM has enough free memory.
It might be possible, when you open multiple tabs that JBoss server run out of memory. When this happens you will get error.
Close all tabs and execute step 1-



3-  The ant test alone can take up to 1.7 GB of RAM. It is recommanded to stop JBOSS server before running the ant test (if you don't have enough memory).

Don't limit ant maximum memory or increase it and make sure java process are allowed to have up to 1.7 GB.

Be patient, the ant test can take a while. On my system (Multicore 3GHz) it took 5 min. 




4- Don't forget to make sure the postgres database is started



5- The submission includes all needed librairies.
