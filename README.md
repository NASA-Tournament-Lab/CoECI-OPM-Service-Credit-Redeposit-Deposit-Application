Service Credit Re-deposit/Deposit (SCRD) Application
====

Hello,

This repository houses code for the United States Office of Personnel Management Service Credit Re-deposit/Deposit (SCRD) Application.

The mission of the SCRD is to compute deposits and re-deposits, create an initial bill, post payments, and send out receipts to federal employees for periods of federal employment service that were either not covered by retirement deductions (deposits), or were covered and later refunded by the federal government (re-deposits). 

The SCRD is a flexible system that can be easily updated or modified for ongoing legislative mandates and is able to provide robust accounting tools for posting and adjusting payments. 

This application was developed in collaboration with NASA’s Center of Excellence for Collaboration (CoECI), Harvard Business School in association with Harvard’s Institute of Quantitative Social Science, and TopCoder.

Thanks, 
-The CoECI Team.
